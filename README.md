# RecipeManager
A recipe manager project with google sign in

New "Add recipe" feature requires that you mention the categories and ingredients seperated by comas.
Example:
Add ingredients: "salt, oil, tuna"
Categories to attach: "1,38,20,99"

A validation is done to check whether you entered a valid category number.
